What is String?

String is sequence of character enclosed by single and double quote.

How we can declare a string?

var string_name;
let string_name;
const string_name;

How we can initialize a string?

var string_name="String";
let string_name="Ram";
const string_name='Jodu';

String Indexing:-

Every character in string denoted by a special character pr special integer value,called index value.

Now,javascript follows 0-based indexing means that start character always at 0th index and the end character always at length-1 index.

How do I get length of the string?

String is also a built in object Inside the javascript,there is a property called length by using that length property we can find the length of the string.

example=>

var s="String";
console.log(s.length); // we get 6 in console.

How do I access character in string?

var s="String";

we can access each character in string by using index number.

console.log(s[1]); // it will print t in console

Facts about string

1.First index value is always 0.

2 Last index value is always length-1.

Inside the string.js we demonstrate all the concepts

Task 1:- Printing all character of string using for loop.
code=>all_char.js

String Immutability:-

In javascript,string is immutable in nature means once we created a string,we cannot change or modifiy value of string without initialize it.

for example

if we declare a string s

var s="String";

now we apply a method on the string.

s.toUpperCase(); 

Now,it does not change the value of the string.but if we assign it then it will change it's value.

s=s.toUpperCase(); it will change the value.

That's the prove of immutability natue in javascript string.

inside the immutable.js we demonstrate immutability natue of string.

How to convert number to string?

There are to ways to convert a number to string.

1. By adding a empty string with number.

example 

var a=123;
console.log(typeof a); // we get number in console
a=123+" ";
console.log(typeof a); // we get string in console

2. By using wrapper object(String)

var a=123;
console.log(typeof a); //we get number
a=String(a);
console.log(typeof a); //we get string

How to convert string to number?

1. By adding + operator before the string we can convert string to number.

var s="122";
console.log(typeof s); //we get string
s=+s;
console.log(typeof s); //we get number

2.By using Number wrapper object we convert string to number.

var s="123";
console.log(typeof s); //we get string
s=Number(s);
console.log(typeof s); // we get number

We demonstrate this in num_string.js file


How to concatinating multiple string?

There are two ways to concatinating the string:-

1.By using + operator we can concatinating string.

var s="Subhadeep";

var a="My name is: ";

var d=a+s;

console.log(d);

2.By using concat() method

concat() a immutating method. I will concat() multiple string and built a new string.

syntax:-

string_name.concat(string1,.......,stringN);
var s="Subhadeep";

var a="My name is: ";
s.concat(a);
var d=d.concat(s,a);

concat.js we demonstrate the concepts of concating

Is the string is object or primitive?

We all know that string is primitive but if the string is primitive the how we can access the length property.

Actually what happend inside, we all now that for all datatype a sperate copy of built in object is available in global object.

when we do s.length, then js engine internally converted into a temporary string to object then perform all operation and after that it destroy that temporary string.

Template String:-

Template literals is the literals enclosed by bactics(``). allowing multiline string and we can embed expression inside it by using ${} inside the parathesis, we put the expression.

example=> template.js file
