What is datatype?

Datatype represent the type of data.

There are 7 datatype available in javascript.We list it categorically.

1.Basic Datatype=>

1.Number=> All type of Number.

2.Boolean=> It's represent the boolean value. true and false.

3.String=> It's represent the string.

4.BigInt(introduced in ES6)

5.Symbol(introduced in ES6).

2.Composite type or Reference type=>

Object

3.Special datatype=>

1.undefined

2.null.

Inside the datatype.js file we can see the example of all datatype.

typeof operator=> It will return the type of the variable as a string.

syntax=>

typeof variable_name;

Now what is undefined?

Actually,undefined is the property of the global object.Now we now the global object is
window.

if we do console.log(window.undefined); then we accessed the property.

Now, when we declare a variable but didnot assign the variable then JS engine store
that undefined in it.

What is BigInt?

BigInt comes into picture in ES6 edition of javascript.

Actually, Number datatype needs 64bit memory to store the data.

for this we need to know the max_safe integer we have a property in number class.

we get 9007199254740991 this,if we need big data then we use BigInt datatype,

var n=123n; //that's the way to define a bigInt data.

In,Bigint.js file we show that.

Facts about datatype:-

For all the datatype,in javascript a sperate copy of built-int object is available.
that's called wrapper object.

When we want to acces those property of object,js engine automatically converted primitive to that object.
