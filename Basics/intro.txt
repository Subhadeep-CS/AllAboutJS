In 1995 Netscape Navigator was a popular web browser.They wanted to bring a programming Language
which can add some functionality on the website.

Brendan Eich in 1995 introduced javascript within 10 days they completed whole task and
named it Mocha. Then,they changed the name and introduced LiveScript.

But this thing doesnot get popularity much and wheb LiveScript introduced in the market,one
of the popular language at that time is Java,So only for popularity they changed the name
from LiveScript to JavaScript.

In that time Internet Explorer is one of the popular web browser.Microsoft observed that
Netscape gets more popularity because of JavaScript.Then they add some features on JavaScript
and launch a new language called jScript.

In that time normal people face the problem,If we choose JavaScript that will run only
on Netscape navigator and if we choose jScript that will run only on Internet Explorer.

For,this reason ECMA(It's a international Organization) say I am that person who can 
spcify some rules over the language.

1997, ES1 launched and ES6 : 2015 (biggest update in the JavaScript history)

In ECMA there is a technical community TC39,this community decide which featires
will add on the javascript.

JavaScript is backward compatable language.(older verson also can work)

JavaScript is not a forward compatable language.

We use babel for run lower version JavaScript.
